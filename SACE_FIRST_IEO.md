# SACE IEO Listing Framework

## Overview
Standard African Currency Equivalent (SACE) has successfully completed a major upgrade and is now benchmarked to the DXY Index rather than a single USD currency. This shift gives SACE a stronger, more globally diversified valuation foundation aligned with international standards while maintaining its African economic representation through its 21 top-performing national currencies.

## IEO Allocation
A total of 2.5 billion SACE tokens have been allocated for the Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) phase.
For the initial listing stage, 300 million SACE tokens will be listed on P2B Exchange to initiate trading and establish organic market-driven price discovery.

| Exchange      | Tokens Listed      | Percentage of IEO Supply | Status     |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| P2B Exchange   | 300,000,000 SACE  | 12%                       | TBA   |

## Token Valuation
Each SACE token is valued at $23 USD, reflecting its representation of Africa’s Top 21 Performing National Currencies, whose combined weighted basket index is valued at approximately $2.3 trillion USD.

This valuation approach reinforces SACE’s purpose:
"To symbolize Africa’s unified economic and monetary strength through a blockchain-standardized digital equivalent."

## Key Highlights
- Benchmark: Pegged to the DXY Index (diversified global value base)
- Economic Base: 21 of Africa’s top-performing national currencies
- Total Combined Valuation: Approximately $2.3 trillion USD — the gross economic value represented by the SACE Index
- Regional Focus: Pan-African with global interoperability
- Listing Exchange: P2B Exchange (Initial IEO Phase)
- Valuation Basis: $23 per SACE token
- IEO Allocation: 2.5 billion SACE
- Initial Listing: 300 million SACE (12%)

## Valuation Derivation Formula
The combined gross value of Africa’s top 21 performing currencies represents approximately $2.3 trillion USD.
Dividing this total by the notional valuation multiplier of 100 million equivalent monetary units gives the derived value per token:

    $2,300,000,000,000 / 100,000,000 = $23

Thus, the intrinsic base price of each SACE token is established at $23.
