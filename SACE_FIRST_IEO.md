It represents a weighted basket of Africa’s top 21 performing national currencies and is benchmarked against the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). SACE is designed to function as a transparent, tradable benchmark for Africa’s macroeconomic performance, foreign exchange exposure, and cross-border trade facilitation.

## IEO Allocation
A total of 2.5 billion SACE tokens have been allocated for the Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) phase.
For the initial listing stage, 1.5 million SACE tokens will be listed on **Bitmart Exchange** to initiate trading and establish organic market-driven price discovery.

| Exchange      | Tokens Listed      | Percentage of IEO Supply | Status     |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| Bitmart Exchange   | 1,500,000 SACE  | 0.06%                       | TBA   |

## Token Valuation
Each SACE token is valued at $23 USD, reflecting its representation of Africa’s Top 21 Performing National Currencies, whose combined weighted basket index is valued at approximately $2.3 trillion USD.

This valuation approach reinforces SACE’s purpose:
"To symbolize Africa’s unified economic and monetary strength through a blockchain-standardized digital equivalent."

## Key Highlights
- Benchmark: Pegged to the DXY Index (diversified global value base)
- Economic Base: 21 of Africa’s top-performing national currencies
- Total Combined Valuation: Approximately $2.3 trillion USD — the gross economic value represented by the SACE Index
- Regional Focus: Pan-African with global interoperability
- Listing Exchange: Bitmart Exchange (Initial IEO Phase)
- Valuation Basis: $23 per SACE token
- IEO Allocation: 2.5 billion SACE
- Initial Listing: 1.5 million SACE (0.06%)

## Valuation Derivation Formula
The combined gross value of Africa’s top 21 performing currencies represents approximately $2.3 trillion USD.
Dividing this total by the notional valuation multiplier of 100 million equivalent monetary units gives the derived value per token:

    $2,300,000,000,000 / 100,000,000 = $23

Thus, the intrinsic base price of each SACE token is established at $23.
