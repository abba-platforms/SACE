## Overview
The Synthetic African Currency Exchange (SACE Index) is a blockchain-native index token deployed on BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20). It represents a weighted basket of Africa’s top 21 performing national currencies and is benchmarked against the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY). SACE is designed to function as a transparent, tradable benchmark for Africa’s macroeconomic performance, foreign exchange exposure, and cross-border trade facilitation.

## IEO Allocation
A total of 2.5 billion SACE tokens have been allocated for the Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) phase.
For the initial listing stage, 30 million SACE tokens will be listed on **UpBit Exchange** to initiate trading and establish organic market-driven price discovery.

| Exchange      | Tokens Listed      | Percentage of IEO Supply | Status     |
|----------------|-------------------|---------------------------|-------------|
| UpBit Exchange   | 30,000,000 SACE  | 0.03%                       | TBA   |

## Token Valuation
Each SACE token is valued at $23 USD, reflecting its representation of Africa’s Top 21 Performing National Currencies, whose combined weighted basket index is valued at approximately $2.3 trillion USD.

This valuation approach reinforces SACE’s purpose:
"To symbolize Africa’s unified economic and monetary strength through a blockchain-standardized digital equivalent."

## Key Highlights
- Benchmark: Pegged to the DXY Index (diversified global value base)
- Economic Base: 21 of Africa’s top-performing national currencies
- Total Combined Valuation: Approximately $2.3 trillion USD — the gross economic value represented by the SACE Index
- Regional Focus: Pan-African with global interoperability
- Listing Exchange: UpBit Exchange (Initial IEO Phase)
- Valuation Basis: $23 per SACE token
- IEO Allocation: 2.5 billion SACE
- Initial Listing: 30 million SACE (0.03%)

## Valuation Derivation Formula
The combined gross value of Africa’s top 21 performing currencies represents approximately $2.3 trillion USD.
Dividing this total by the notional valuation multiplier of 100 million equivalent monetary units gives the derived value per token:

    $2,300,000,000,000 / 100,000,000 = $23

Thus, the intrinsic base price of each SACE token is established at $23.
