# SACE Basket Value Analysis

## Overview

The Synthetic African Currency Exchange (**SACE**) represents a weighted basket of Africa’s top 21 performing currencies.  

As of October 2025, the combined estimated value of this basket is approximately **$2.3 trillion USD**.

Since SACE’s current max supply is set at **100 billion tokens**, we have set a starting price of **$23 USD per SACE**.  
This makes the token more affordable while reflecting the proportional value of the underlying currency basket.

## Market Cap and Index Valuation

- **Basket Combined Value:** $2.3 trillion USD  
- **Max Supply:** 100,000,000,000 SACE  
- **Starting Price per Token:** $23 USD  

This gives an approximate **market capitalization** at launch of:

```
100,000,000,000 SACE × $23 = $2.3 trillion USD
```

This aligns SACE’s total market cap proportionally with the estimated value of the African currency basket it represents.

## Proportional Movements Relative to USD

SACE’s price is designed to reflect the performance of the African currency basket.  
This means price movement relative to USD will follow changes in the basket’s value:

- **If the basket strengthens** relative to USD → SACE price increases.
- **If USD strengthens** relative to the basket → SACE price decreases.

Example:  
If African currencies collectively appreciate by 5% vs USD, SACE’s price could rise from $23 → **$24.15**.

This creates a **naturally hedged asset** against USD volatility.

## Long-Term Performance Simulation

Looking at historical growth patterns of indexes like NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500, Africa’s currency basket could similarly grow over time.

| Year | Low Growth (5%) | Moderate Growth (10%) | High Growth (15%) |
|------|-------------------|------------------------|---------------------|
| 0    | $23.00           | $23.00                 | $23.00             |
| 1    | $24.15           | $25.30                 | $26.45             |
| 2    | $25.36           | $27.83                 | $30.42             |
| 3    | $26.63           | $30.61                 | $35.00             |
| 4    | $27.96           | $33.67                 | $40.25             |
| 5    | $29.36           | $37.04                 | $46.29             |
| 6    | $30.83           | $40.74                 | $53.23             |
| 7    | $32.37           | $44.81                 | $61.21             |
| 8    | $34.00           | $49.29                 | $70.39             |
| 9    | $35.70           | $54.22                 | $80.95             |
| 10   | $37.49           | $59.64                 | $93.10             |

**Interpretation:**  
- **Low growth (5%)** → $37.49 after 10 years (+63%).  
- **Moderate growth (10%)** → $59.64 after 10 years (+159%).  
- **High growth (15%)** → $93.10 after 10 years (+305%).  

These scenarios suggest SACE could follow a sustained upward trajectory akin to major global indexes, driven by Africa’s economic growth and adoption of SACE.

## Strategic Insight

SACE is designed as a **dynamic index** and a **transparent tradable instrument** that tracks Africa’s collective currency strength.  
Its price movement will be proportional to the basket’s performance versus USD, offering a natural hedge and exposure to Africa’s currency markets.

### Key Points:
- Starting price of $23 per SACE is **proportional to the USD value of the basket**.
- With 100B max supply, the total market cap is aligned with the basket’s estimated $2.3 trillion value.
- Price will fluctuate with the basket’s performance, offering a **hedging mechanism**.
- Long-term growth potential mirrors indexes like NASDAQ 100 and S&P 500, driven by African economic growth and adoption.
