## Abstract

**Synthetic African Currency Exchange (SACE)** is a blockchain-native BEP-20 token engineered to represent a **weighted basket of Africa’s top-performing currencies** benchmarked directly to the **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)**. By creating a synthetic currency index for Africa, SACE delivers a unified benchmark for tracking the continent’s economic strength.

Inspired by the proven model of the **DXY**, **S&P 500**, **Dow Jones Industrial Averages (DJIA)**, and **NASDAQ 100**, SACE offers a transparent, tradable instrument that reflects Africa’s collective economic performance, facilitates cross-border trade, and provides **traders and investors** a powerful tool for exposure and hedging within the **African forex landscape**.

SACE is a development brand of **Abba Payments Ltd.**, a wholly-owned subsidiary of **Abba Platforms Inc.**, created by **Simon Kapenda**, the creator of **CillarCoin (CILLAR)** — a utility token — and **Namibia Digital Dollar (NADD)**, Namibia's first blockchain-native stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Namibian Dollar. Simon Kapenda holds a Bachelor of Science degree in Economics from **The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio, USA**, where he graduated in 2008 alongside **JD Vance, Vice President of the United States**.

SACE serves as:
- **A tradable synthetic index** paired against USD or other basket currencies.
- **A transparent liquidity instrument** for African currencies.
- **A governance-driven financial infrastructure** to track Africa’s overall economic strength, performance, and movement.

## 1. Executive Summary

The **Synthetic African Currency Exchange (SACE)** is a BEP-20 token representing a **weighted basket of Africa’s top 21 performing national currencies**, collectively valued at more than **$2.3 trillion USD**. SACE is inspired by global benchmarks such as the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**, **S&P 500**, **NASDAQ 100**, and the **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)**. It provides a unified, tradable instrument enabling investors, institutions, and policymakers to track and trade Africa’s collective currency strength through a single token: **the SACE Index**.  

A key structural feature of the SACE Index is that it is benchmarked directly to the **U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)**. The DXY is the world's most widely used measurement of the U.S. dollar's global value, and linking SACE to the DXY provides an internationally recognized anchor. By combining the stability and global relevance of the DXY with the internal weighting of African currency data, SACE creates a new hybrid valuation system that reflects both global and regional economic realities.

SACE is deployed on the **BNB Smart Chain (BEP-20)** and operates using algorithmic index calculations, decentralized price feeds, and an **on-chain Oracle Registry** to validate all incoming data. The system continuously monitors Chainlink price feeds, verifies deviation tolerances, and updates the SACE Index only when data meets strict integrity requirements. Historical pricing, transparency, and automated governance ensure that SACE maintains predictable behavior and strong auditability.

The result is the first synthetic digital currency designed for Africa, engineered to be resilient, data-backed, and globally interoperable. SACE functions as a benchmark asset for African macroeconomic value, a collateral-ready instrument for decentralized finance, and a stable medium of exchange for digital commerce across African markets and beyond.

Developed by **Simon Kapenda**, Founder of **Abba Platforms Inc.**, and creator of **CillarCoin (CILLAR)** and **Namibia Digital Dollar (NADD)** (Namibia’s first blockchain-native stablecoin), SACE establishes a digital bridge between Africa’s diverse currency landscape and the global market economy.

By aggregating a **weighted basket of 21 African currencies**, SACE introduces a new paradigm for cross-border trade efficiency, investment exposure, and currency stability — making it the **first synthetic currency index for Africa**.

Upon the debut of SACE’s Initial Exchange Offering (IEO), SACE is projected to enter the global digital economy with a **valuation exceeding $2.3 trillion USD**, positioning **Abba Platforms Inc.** among the world’s most valuable technology and fintech companies. Each of its **42 founding staff and management members** is projected to hold a net worth exceeding **$230 million USD**, making them among the wealthiest individuals across Africa, the United States, and beyond.

## 9. SACE Basket Value

### Overview

The **Synthetic African Currency Exchange (SACE)** represents a **weighted basket of Africa’s top 21 performing currencies**, capturing Africa’s collective monetary strength within a single blockchain-based index token.

As of **October 2025**, the combined estimated value of this 21-currency basket is approximately **$2.3 trillion USD**.

Based on this aggregate valuation and the **maximum supply of 100 billion SACE tokens**, the **market-derived indicative value** of one SACE is estimated at **around $23 USD**.

This value is **not a fixed or imposed price**, but rather a **proportional reflection** of the overall strength and capitalization of Africa’s top currencies relative to the U.S. Dollar (USD).

It provides a transparent benchmark for traders and investors — allowing SACE to naturally price itself in open markets according to currency performance and market demand.

---

### SACE-to-DXY Benchmark Calculation

**SACE is directly benchmarked to the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY).** This means:

* The SACE Basket Index (SBI) is first calculated from the weighted African currency basket.
* The SBI is then normalized against DXY using the formula:

```
SACE_Index = SBI * (DXY / 100)
```

This alignment ensures that SACE moves proportionally with African currency strength *and* U.S. Dollar global strength.

---

### **Weighted Basket Calculation (Example)**

Assumptions:

* 21 African currencies
* USD exchange rate normalization
* Weighted economic contribution

```
| Currency | USD Rate | Weight (%) | Weighted Contribution |
|----------|----------|------------|------------------------|

### **Step 1: Sum All Weighted Contributions**

```
Total Weighted Sum (SBI_raw) = 0.05604
```

### **Step 2: Compute the DXY-Normalized Basket Index**

Assume:

```
Current DXY = 104
Normalized SBI = SBI_raw * (DXY / 100)
               = 0.05604 * 1.04
               = 0.05828
```

### **Step 3: Map to SACE Token Price**

```
Basket Value = $2,300,000,000,000
Max Supply   = 100,000,000,000

Price per SACE = Basket Value * Normalized SBI / Max Supply
                = 2.3T * 0.05828 / 100B
                ≈ $23.69 USD
```

---

### **Step 4: Example Scenarios with DXY Influence**

#### **If African currencies strengthen by +5%**

```
SBI_raw_new = 0.05604 * 1.05 = 0.05884
Normalized = 0.05884 * 1.04 = 0.06119
Price ≈ $24.36
```

#### **If African currencies weaken by -5%**

```
SBI_raw_new = 0.05604 * 0.95 = 0.05324
Normalized = 0.05324 * 1.04 = 0.05537
Price ≈ $21.43
```

---

### **Key Takeaway**

SACE reflects BOTH:

1. The real-time economic strength of Africa’s top 21 performing national currencies
2. The global position of the U.S. Dollar via the DXY index

This creates a **globally-aligned, transparent, and economically grounded synthetic currency benchmark.**

## 10. Oracle Feed Deviation Handling (Appendix — ASCII Diagram)

```
           +------------------------+
           | New Chainlink Price    |
           | Feed Received          |
           +-----------+------------+
                       |
                       v
           +-----------+------------+
           | Compare with Last Valid |
           | Price                   |
           +-----------+------------+
                       |
        +--------------+---------------+
        |                              |
        v                              v
+------------------+           +------------------+
| Within Allowed   |           | Exceeds Allowed  |
| Deviation (<=5%) |           | Deviation (>5%)  |
+--------+---------+           +--------+---------+
         |                              |
         v                              v
+--------+---------+           +--------+---------+
| Update Last      |           | Reject Feed      |
| Valid Price      |           | Emit Warning     |
| Emit Event       |           | Maintain Old     |
+------------------+           | Last Price       |
                               +------------------+
```
       
**Flow Explanation:**
1. **New Price Feed:** Chainlink submits a new currency rate.  
2. **Deviation Check:** Feed compared against last valid price.  
3. **If within threshold (≤5% default):** Update the stored last valid price, emit an event for transparency.  
4. **If deviation exceeds threshold:** Reject the feed, emit warning, maintain previous valid price for safety.  
5. **Heartbeat Check:** Any feed older than 1 hour is automatically rejected to prevent stale data.  

This mechanism ensures SACE price integrity, protects against oracle manipulation, and maintains a reliable synthetic currency index.
