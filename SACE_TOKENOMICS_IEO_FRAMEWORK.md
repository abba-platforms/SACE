# SACE TOKENOMICS & IEO FRAMEWORK

## 1. Overview
The **Synthetic African Currency Exchange ($SACE)** is a **BEP-20 token** representing a weighted basket of Africa’s top 21 currencies with a combined value of over **$2.3 trillion USD**. Inspired by benchmarks such as the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), SACE offers a unified, tradable instrument — a single instrument for tracking and trading Africa’s collective currency strength.  

By consolidating Africa’s top 21 currencies into one synthetic index, SACE creates a transparent benchmark for Africa’s currency performance, enhances market efficiency, improves liquidity, enables hedging against currency volatility, and facilitates cross-border trade.  

**Project Owner:** Abba Platforms Inc., created by Simon Kapenda, innovator behind **CillarCoin ($CILLAR)** and **Namibia Digital Dollar ($NADD)**, Namibia’s first blockchain-native stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Namibian Dollar and backed by hybrid on-ledger and fiat reserves.

### Token Pricing Rationale
The initial price of **$23 per SACE** is designed to reflect the total synthetic value of Africa’s top 21 currencies, estimated at **$2.3 trillion USD**. By pricing SACE at $23, the full max supply of 100 billion tokens aligns proportionally with this synthetic basket valuation.  

This pricing ensures that SACE acts as a **transparent, market-representative benchmark** for Africa’s collective currency strength, enabling investors to gauge and trade the continent’s currency performance accurately from day one.
