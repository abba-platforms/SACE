The **Synthetic African Currency Exchange (SACE)** creates a unique economic instrument that aggregates the strength of Africaâ€™s top currencies into a single tradable token. By doing so, SACE addresses key economic challenges:  

- **Market Efficiency:** Simplifies exposure to African currencies, reducing the complexity of multi-currency forex trading.

In effect, SACE functions as Africaâ€™s **currency performance index**, much like the DXY for the U.S. dollar, and has the potential to become a core instrument in the continentâ€™s financial ecosystem.
