## SACE IEO Listing Framework

SACE has chosen to conduct its first Initial Exchange Offering (IEO) on **UpBit Exchange**. This IEO will begin with 300 million SACE tokens, priced at $23 USD per token, based on the weighted basket of Africa's top 21 performing national currencies (combined gross value: $2.3 trillion USD).

For full details, see the [SACE IEO Listing Framework](./SACE_FIRST_IEO.md).

## Executive Summary 

The **Synthetic African Currency Exchange (SACE)** is a BEP-20 token representing a **weighted basket of Africa’s top 21 performing national currencies**, collectively valued at more than **$2.3 trillion USD**. Benchmarked directly to the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY), SACE is inspired by global benchmarks such as the **Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA)**, **S&P 500**, **NASDAQ 100**, and the **DXY**. It provides a unified, tradable instrument enabling investors, institutions, and policymakers to track and trade Africa’s collective currency strength through a single token: **the SACE Index**.  

SACE consolidates Africa’s top 21 currencies into a single tradable instrument, creating a transparent benchmark for the continent’s currency performance. It enhances market efficiency, improves liquidity, enables effective hedging against currency volatility, and facilitates cross-border trade — positioning SACE as a foundational economic tool for Africa’s growing financial ecosystem.

Additionally, the **SACE Index is benchmarked directly to the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY)**, ensuring that its valuation aligns with globally recognized macroeconomic standards. This integration provides greater stability, reduces single-currency dependency, and enhances international investor confidence by anchoring SACE to a diversified basket of major world currencies rather than a single USD peg.

SACE is a development brand of **Abba Platforms Inc.**, created by **Simon Kapenda**, the creator of **CillarCoin (CILLAR)** — a utility token — and **Namibia Digital Dollar (NADD)**, Namibia's first blockchain-native stablecoin pegged 1:1 to the Namibian Dollar. Together, **SACE**, **CILLAR**, and **NADD** form the foundation of Abba Platforms’ digital asset ecosystem — advancing Africa’s financial inclusion, liquidity, and cross-border economic integration through blockchain innovation.

## 🧩 SACE Contract Overview

The Synthetic African Currency Exchange (**SACE**) is deployed on **BNB Smart Chain (Mainnet)** and operates through a verifiable, upgradeable contract architecture designed for transparency, real-time data accuracy, and investor trust.

**Core Contracts:**
- **SACE Proxy (Main Contract):** `0x9F6d0EDc0eB6BBa34F06CeC4fbA7f91bb4600F73`  
- **SACE Implementation:** `0xf84D3BA755a5c8FBffb2776948F61676552f39bB`  
- **SACE Oracle Registry:** `0x96DCdC8C5A5C2B2Fdb5CB1C882234311b2dc797d` 
- **SACE Price Updater:** `0x8C4A89223af9Ce160927D6Fcbd85e10084eAB7Bc`

SACE uses a **hybrid oracle system** combining **Chainlink’s on-chain data feeds** (for major currencies like ZAR) and **SACE’s Hybrid Feeds** (for other African currencies). The Hybrid Feeds aggregate real-time market data from sources such as **OANDA, XE, and Investing.com**, which are validated and published on-chain every hour. This ensures accurate, transparent, and verifiable price updates — all visible on **BscScan**.

The upgradeable UUPS Proxy model allows the SACE protocol to evolve without changing its main contract address, ensuring both stability for users and flexibility for future innovation. Every feed update, logic change, and timestamp is **recorded immutably on-chain**, allowing investors and traders to independently verify that SACE operates with full transparency.

📄 **Full technical explanation and interaction diagram:**  
See [SACE_CONTRACTS_SUMMARY.md](./SACE_CONTRACTS_SUMMARY.md)

## SACE Price Feed System

The **SACE Price Feed System** provides reliable and upgradeable price feeds for SACE and related assets, using a UUPS proxy architecture that supports both Chainlink and hybrid feed types.  

For full details, architecture diagrams, and currency feed structure, see [SACE_CONTRACT_FLOW.md](SACE_CONTRACT_FLOW.md).

---

## SACE System Architect 

The SACE System Architect is composed of the **SACE Proxy & Implementation**, together with **SACEOracleRegistry** and **SACEPriceUpdater**, with **Security and Governance** enforced via a **Gnosis Safe multisig** controlling all critical operations. It includes a System Flow Diagram providing an end-to-end overview of the oracle → updater → proxy pipeline. For the complete architecture, detailed deployment information, and flow diagrams, see the full documentation: [SACE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECT.md](./SACE_SYSTEM_ARCHITECT.md)

## 📊 SACE Basket Value Summary

As the Synthetic African Currency Exchange (**SACE**) representing a weighted basket of Africa’s top 21 performing currencies, the combined estimated value of this basket is approximately **$2.3 trillion USD**, as of October 2025.

With a max supply of **100 billion SACE tokens**, the starting market price is approximately **$23 USD per SACE** — determined by market conditions to reflect the proportional value of the underlying currency basket.

For a full in-depth analysis, valuation breakdown, and long-term growth projections, see the dedicated document:  
📄 [SACE_BASKET_VALUE.md](./SACE_BASKET_VALUE.md)

---

## Benchmarking

SACE is benchmarked against the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) rather than a single U.S. Dollar.  
This pairing anchors SACE’s value to the real-world strength of the U.S. Dollar relative to a basket of major global currencies — **EUR, JPY, GBP, CAD, SEK, and CHF**.  

Through its on-chain, upgradeable **UUPS architecture**, SACE integrates **DXY price feeds** from trusted oracles to ensure transparency, macroeconomic stability, and alignment with global market movements.  

For a complete technical breakdown, see the [SACE_BENCHMARK.md](SACE_BENCHMARK.md) document in this repository.

## Economic Analysis

The **Synthetic African Currency Exchange (SACE)** creates a unique economic instrument that aggregates the strength of Africa’s top currencies into a single tradable token. By doing so, SACE addresses key economic challenges:  

- **Market Efficiency:** Simplifies exposure to African currencies, reducing the complexity of multi-currency forex trading.  
- **Liquidity Creation:** Consolidates liquidity for African currencies, making them more accessible to global investors.  
- **Hedging Tool:** Provides a standardized way for investors, businesses, and governments to hedge against currency volatility.  
- **Transparency:** Offers a clear benchmark for Africa’s collective currency performance, promoting informed economic decisions.  
- **Trade Facilitation:** Supports cross-border trade by reducing currency conversion friction and providing a stable reference currency.  

In effect, SACE functions as Africa’s **currency performance index**, much like the DXY for the U.S. dollar, and has the potential to become a core instrument in the continent’s financial ecosystem.
